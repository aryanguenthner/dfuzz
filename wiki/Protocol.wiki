=Synchronization=
Protocol will be asynchronous. <br> 
Messages will be transfered over TCP connection. <br> 
Messages should be transfered over an encrypted tunnel from and to a client and a server. <br> 
Client to client interaction is a feature that will be explored in later releases of dfuzz. <br>
Messages will typically exhibit a REQUEST RESPONSE behavior. <br>
