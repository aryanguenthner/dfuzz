PUSH DELETE
 * Message from the server that will tell the client to delete a local resource

PUSH KILL
 * Message from the server that will kill a process or set of processes

PUSH START
 * Message from the server to the client to start a fuzzing or analysis sequence

PUSH CMD
 * Message from the server to the client to execute a command

PUSH RESPONSE
 * Message from the client to the server acknowledging the request and responding with a status code (eg., Success, Error, Acknowledge-Continue)

==QUERY==

QUERY STATUS
 * Message from the server asking for the status of running fuzzing operations

QUERY RESOURCES
 * Message from the server asking for a resource count (memory, cpu usage, etc) on the client

QUERY SETUP
 * Message from the server asking what applications, configurations and data are installed on the client

QUERY PROGRESS
 * Message from the server to the client asking about information on a particular job

QUERY RESPONSE

==REPORT==

REPORT CRASH
 * Message from the client telling the server that an application being fuzzed crashed. The message will also detail information about the crash

REPORT PROGRESS
 * Message from the client telling the server the progress of fuzzing

REPORT READY
 * Message from the client telling the server that it is up and ready to fuzz. This will be the first message sent to the server. 

REPORT ERROR

=Synchronization=
Protocol will be asynchronous. <br> 
Messages will be transferred over TCP connection. <br>
Messages shall be transferred over TCP port 12456. Data shall be transferred over port 22. <br> 
Messages should be transferred over an encrypted tunnel from and to a client and a server. <br> 
Client to client interaction is a potential feature that will be explored in later releases of dfuzz. <br>
Server to server interaction is a potential feature that will be explored in later releases of dfuzz. <br>
Messages will typically exhibit a REQUEST RESPONSE behavior. <br>
