    antiparser
        Written in Python, simple and limited fuzzing framework.
    Autodafe
        Can be perceived as a more powerful version of SPIKE. It’s main contribution is the introduction of a UNIX-based debugging agent capable of weighting the possibility of a crash on any given fuzz input.
    AxMan
        A web-based ActiveX fuzzing engine written by HD Moore.
    bugger
        A Linux in-process fuzzer written by Michal Zalewski.
    COMRaider
        A Windows GUI fuzzer written by David Zimmer, designed to fuzz COM Object Interfaces.
    Dfuz
        Written in C, exposes a custom and easy to use scripting language for fuzzer deveopment.
    DOM-Hanoi
        Written by H D Moore and Aviv Raff, DOM-Hanoi is designed to identify common DHTML implementation flaws by adding/removing DOM elements
    Evolutionary Fuzzing System 
        A fuzzer which attempts to dynamically learn a protocol using code coverage and other feedback mechanisms.
    FileH
        A haskell-based file fuzzer that generates mutated files from a list of source files and feeds them to an external program in batches.
    FileP
        A python-based file fuzzer that generates mutated files from a list of source files and feeds them to an external program in batches.
    Fuzzled
        A Perl based generic fuzzing framework.
    General Purpose Fuzzer 
        Written in C, GPF has a number of modes ranging from simple pure random fuzzing to more complex protocol tokenization.
    hamachi
        Written by H D Moore and Aviv Raff, Hamachi will look for common DHTML implementation flaws by specifying common “bad” values for method arguments and property values.
    Malybuzz
        A Python tool focused in discovering programming faults in network software.
    mangleme
        An automated broken HTML generator and browser tester, originally used to find dozens of security and reliability problems in all major Web browsers.
    Peach
        Written in Python, an advanced and robust fuzzing framework which successfully separates and abstracts relevant concepts. Learning curve is a bit overwhelming.
    Protocol Informatics
        Slides, whitepaper and code from the last publicly seen snapshot from Marshall Beddoe’s work.
    QueFuzz
        Small fuzzer that uses libnetfilter_queue to take in packets from iptables. It’s fuzzing engine either randomly fuzzes binary or ASCII protocols or uses a basic fuzzing template to search and replace packet data.
    Schemer
        XML driven generic file and protocol fuzzer.
    SMUDGE
        Pure Python network protocol fuzzer from nd@felincemenace.
    SPIKE
        Written in C, exposes a custom API for fuzzer development. Probably the most widely used and popular framework.
    TAOF (The Art of Fuzzing)
        Written in Python, a cross-platform GUI driven network protocol fuzzing environment for both UNIX and Windows systems.
