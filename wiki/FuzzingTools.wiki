|| antiparser || Python || N/A || N/A || Written in Python, simple and limited fuzzing framework. ||
|| Autodafe || N/A || N/A || N/A || Can be perceived as a more powerful version of SPIKE. It’s main contribution is the introduction of a UNIX-based debugging agent capable of weighting the possibility of a crash on any given fuzz input. ||
|| AxMan || N/A || N/A || N/A || A web-based ActiveX fuzzing engine written by HD-Moore. ||
|| Bugger || N/A || Linux || N/A || A Linux in-process fuzzer written by Michal Zalewski. ||
|| COMRaider || N/A || Win || N/A || A Windows GUI fuzzer written by David Zimmer, designed to fuzz COM Object Interfaces. ||
|| Dfuz || C || N/A || N/A || Written in C, exposes a custom and easy to use scripting language for fuzzer deveopment. ||
|| DOM-Hanoi || N/A || N/A || N/A || Written by H D Moore and Aviv Raff, DOM-Hanoi is designed to identify common DHTML implementation flaws by adding/removing DOM elements ||
|| Evolutionary Fuzzing System || N/A || N/A || N/A || A fuzzer which attempts to dynamically learn a protocol using code coverage and other feedback mechanisms. ||
|| FileH || N/A || N/A || N/A || A haskell-based file fuzzer that generates mutated files from a list of source files and feeds them to an external program in batches. ||
|| FileP || python || N/A || N/A || A python-based file fuzzer that generates mutated files from a list of source files and feeds them to an external program in batches. ||
|| Fuzzled || Perl || N/A || N/A || A Perl based generic fuzzing framework. ||
|| General Purpose Fuzzer || C || N/A || N/A || Written in C, GPF has a number of modes ranging from simple pure random fuzzing to more complex protocol tokenization. ||
|| hamachi || N/A || N/A || N/A || Written by H D Moore and Aviv Raff, Hamachi will look for common DHTML implementation flaws by specifying common “bad” values for method arguments and property values. ||
|| Malybuzz || Python || N/A || N/A || A Python tool focused in discovering programming faults in network software. ||
|| mangleme || N/A || N/A || N/A || An automated broken HTML generator and browser tester, originally used to find dozens of security and reliability problems in all major Web browsers. ||
|| Peach || Python || N/A || N/A || Written in Python, an advanced and robust fuzzing framework which successfully separates and abstracts relevant concepts. Learning curve is a bit overwhelming. ||
|| Protocol Informatics || N/A || N/A || N/A || Slides, whitepaper and code from the last publicly seen snapshot from Marshall Beddoe’s work. ||
|| QueFuzz || N/A || N/A || N/A || Small fuzzer that uses libnetfilter_queue to take in packets from iptables. It’s fuzzing engine either randomly fuzzes binary or ASCII protocols or uses a basic fuzzing template to search and replace packet data. ||
|| Schemer || N/A || N/A || N/A || XML driven generic file and protocol fuzzer. ||
|| SMUDGE || Python || N/A || N/A || Pure Python network protocol fuzzer from nd@felincemenace. ||
|| SPIKE || N/A || N/A || N/A || Written in C, exposes a custom API for fuzzer development. Probably the most widely used and popular framework. ||
|| TAOF (The Art of Fuzzing) || Python || Win, Linux || N/A || Written in Python, a cross-platform GUI driven network protocol fuzzing environment for both UNIX and Windows systems. ||
